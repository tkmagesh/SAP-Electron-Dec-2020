APIs
    Array, Date, Math, Regex, typeof, timer (setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval)

Unique Features
    A method is an attribute whose value is a function

Line Oriented
Procedural
Object Based
Object Oriented
Functional
    In NON FUnctional languages, functions are mere 'programming constructs'
    Functions are first class citizens
        (funtions can be treated like data/object)
        - functions can be created using function expression
        - functions can have attributes
        - functions can have methods
        - functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
        - functions can be returned as return value from another function
        - functions are variadic by default
        - functions are objects (called 'callable objects' )

        - when invoked, the following implicit objects are available in a function
            - this
            - arguments
                array like object containing all the argument values passed to the function
                has a 'length' attribute (the # of arguments)
                has support for indexer (arguments[0], arguments[1]....)

    Support for higher order functions

    Concept of 'Invocation Context'

    In JavaScript, it DOES NOT matter where the function is OR who owns the function
        what matters is HOW the function is invoked

    Function Invocation Patterns
        - As a method of an object (obj)
            this -> obj

        - As a function
            this -> global (window)

        - Using the 'call' method of the function

        - Using the 'apply' method of the function

        - Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

        - Using the 'new' keyword (Constructor Function)

Constructor Functions
    Functions that behave like class 
    NO syntax differences between a normal function and a constructor function
    To differentiate, a convention is followed : The function name must start with uppercase 
    Constructor Functions are invoked using the 'new' keyword
        - this -> refers to a new object
        - this -> returned by default

dynamic
    An object in javascript is just a dictionary / map / hash 
        - collection of key/value pairs

    Convention :
        When 'write' operation to an attribute
            use the dot notation for updating an existing attribute
            use the [] notation when creating a new attribute

loosely typed

Prototypal Inheritance
    One object (prototype) acts as a base object for a family of objects

Async Operations
    Operation that is initiated but not waited for its completion

    Promise - an object designed to hold the result of an async operation

Electron
    Framework for building desktop applications

    Every electron application is made of the following 2 processes
        main process
        1 or more renderer processes

    Node.js
        JavaScript Runtime
        Scheduling Pattern - Single Threaded Event Loop
        All I/O operations are performed in an async manner

    Chromium
        UI created using HTML + CSS + JS

Electon APIs
    app
        represents the electron application
        used in handling the life cycle events of the application

    BrowserWindow
        to create a renderer process

    Dialog
        System Dialog
            ex, messages, file open, file save as

    IPC
        Inter Process Communication
        ipcMain & ipcRenderer are used for communication between the main process and the renderer process

    
Node
    npm
    package.json (metadata information about the application)
        - name
        - version
        - description
        - keywords
        - repository
        - private
        - author
        - license
        - dependencies
            documents all the other node modules that the application depends on at runtime
        - devDependencies
            documents all the other node modules that the application depends on to perform development activities
        - scripts
            commands for performing development activities in the application
    npm init
